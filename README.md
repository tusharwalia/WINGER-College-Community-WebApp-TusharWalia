Social media webapp

#OVERVIEW
Social media today plays an expanding significant role in society, the information technology industry and the field of computer science. This project aims to deliver a platform with the goal of forming a college community where students with similar interests in the world of entertainment (Movies and Series) can connect with a lot of other features (mentioned later in this file). People nowadays always find it difficult to search and start watching a Movie or a Web Series without recommendations; hence this project solves the problem as each user can view what the other user recommends. This will also help freshers to connect with peers and feel comfortable in a new environment. The proposed solution will be a web application that will offer a unique online community to users.
